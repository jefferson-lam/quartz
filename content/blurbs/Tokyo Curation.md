### Fashion

**GR8**
*Japan, 〒150-0001 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Jingumae, 1 Chome−11−62.5 F*

One of my favorite stores in Tokyo - has more of an international feel featuring brands from all over the world, but with an emphasis on Japanese designers. Lovely curation of magazines (Brutus, Popeyes, 032c, and their own writing, gr8!), fragrances and candles, and designers.

**10tow(トウ)**
*Japan, 〒150-0042 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Udagawacho, 11−6 渋谷宇田川ＫＫビル 4F*

As you climb the stairs, you start hearing a mix of techno, art-pop and experimental rock. Focus on avant-garde designers - a lot of Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Garçons, Issey Miyake. I personally loved their selection of coats, and blazers. Expect to pay around ¥30,000 to ¥60,000 for the most of the collection, but more for things like coats.

**Hinoya**
*6 Chome-10-16 Ueno, Taito City, Tokyo 110-0005, Japan*

If you're Japanese denim nerd like me, you will love this store. The staff are incredibly nice, and resourceful. Offers brands like Samurai, Momotaro, Iron Heart, PBJ, amongst other more lowkey brands not known in the West.

**Archive Store**
*Japan, 〒150-0041 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Jinnan, 1 Chome−12−16 和光ビル B1F*

More of an art exhibit than anything. If you can afford anything here, can we be friends? People generally donate really cool archive collections from designers like Jean-Paul Gaultier, Jun Takahashi, Rick Owens, etc. etc. Last I was here, there was an exhibit on one of Rei Kawakubo's 1990's collection. 

**PAT Market**
*3 Chome-27-8 Jingumae, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0001, Japan*

This is store that replaced the former best store in Tokyo, **Nibbunoichi** (moved to Osaka). Same owner as Nibbunoichi, but with a different kind of selection. You will find a very diverse range of clothes from thrifted things to most archive designer pieces on the second floor. Sketchy entrance (in between buildings) but worth checking out.

**blue room**
Japan, 〒150-0002 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Shibuya, 2 Chome−4−10 鈴木ビル 102

I didn't personally go, but I've heard a lot of great things about their curation. Have a look if you're ever in the area.

**sinot.clothing**
*54-1, Motoyoyogicho, Shibuya City, Tokyo 151-0062, Japan*

Bar none, the best store for actual vintage and pottery made by the owner. Their showroom has actual worn pieces from the early 1900s to now. Owner is super nice and knowledgable and will tell the history of each piece. Filled with grails.

*Bruh*

**ZSC Tokyo**!
*Somewhere*

By far the most gate-kept store I've been to. Amazing collector, amazing eyes for new brands, and someone I enjoy talking to when visiting. Appointment only, except on Saturdays. [ZSC](https://www.2049ltd.com/about)

*Literally.. the entrance. Try it to find it :)*
### Food

Non-exhaustive list of great restaurants I've been to and really enjoyed. One thing I will mention is that it is almost impossible to have a truly bad meal in Japan. Exception: don't go to Ichiban - it's average but not worth the price.

**Sushi no Midori**
*Japan, 〒150-0043 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Dogenzaka, 1 Chome−12−3 マークシティイースト ４Ｆ*

Recommended to me by my Japanese friend turned in to my main recommendation for sushi. Located inside the Shibuya Mark City. You can get the chef's choice for ¥3000 and are presented with a massive selection of fish ranging from amaebi, ōtoro to uni. 

**Tensuke**
*3 Chome-22-7 Koenjikita, Suginami City, Tokyo 166-0002, Japan*

A little out of the way, in Shimokitazawa. And usually a long line, but the chef offers an *Omakase* of various tempura dishes. Intimate seating (room for 8). Great spot after roaming the streets of Shimo. 

**Tatemichiya**
*30-8 Sarugakucho, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0033, Japan*

I forgot how I found the place, but this Izakaya is bar none my favorite in Tokyo. Local feel, little plates with a diverse range of foods. Come here if you wanna dine like a local. Reservation by phone.

**Family Mart**
*Everywhere*

This is going to be a short one. Get the Fami-chiki. I probably ate 40 of them in a week's time. My salaryman friend tells me he rewards himself with a Famichiki after 14 hour work days. I dreamed of it last night and probably had the best sleep in days. 

**7-11**
*Everywhere*

The best convenience store IMO. The egg sandwich, the churro desert and the iced coffee is an unbeaten combo. Don't @ me. 

**Sukiya**
*Everywhere*

Be like a local and eat a bowl of Gyudon for 2$ and that comes out in less than 30 seconds. Dine amongst the tired salarymen and feel the energy. There's a secret menu item that I will gatekeep but can find yourself :) 

### Cafes and Bakeries

Just way too many to list and so many that I didn't go to, so take this list with a grain of salt. Here are the ones I went to that I personally enjoyed.

**365 Days**
*1 Chome-2-8 Tomigaya, Shibuya City, Tokyo 151-0063, Japan*

In Yoyogi, a little astray from Shibuya. I guess usually has a line-up from reading the reviews, but was empty when I went. This place was so good, had such unique and cute pastries, I went three times. Ask for their recommendation of the day and let them take care of you.

*need some right now*

**KOFFEE MAMEYA**
*4 Chome-15-3 Jingumae, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0001, Japan*

Is it worth waiting in line for 3 hours to get in? Probably not. But if the line is short, then by all means go for it. They do a customized coffee blend according to what you like to taste. Pricey, however. 

**I'm Donut?**
*1 Chome-22-10 Kamimeguro, Meguro City, Tokyo 153-0051, Japan*

I'm donut?
### Going out

Tokyo is filled with bars, but to keep things precise and concise, here's a short list of my favorites. I won't include any clubs here because I think they're all very average. Go to an izakaya and kick it with some locals.

**Epulor**
Japan, 〒153-0042 Tokyo, Meguro City, Aobadai, 1 Chome−19−10 エスセナーリオ青葉台 1F

Epulor is a cafe during the day, and turns into a listening bar at night. Ambiance in here is unreal and is located right by the Meguro River, where you can see cherry blossoms.  Played classics like John Mayer's LA concert and remixed some indie j-rock songs - turned on Shahzam on multiple occasions.

### Shops

**Utsuwa Kaede**
*Japan, 〒107-0062 Tokyo, Minato City, Minamiaoyama, 4 Chome−17−1 1F*

My favorite store in Tokyo. Little pottery store (on the higher end) with a focus on local artists. Hosts a lot of exhibits featuring pottery makers around Japan and lets them sell their work. I absolutely love the owner and is the nicest person ever, and got to meet a bunch of local pottery artists here. You get a great local feel for the Tokyo.

**HANACHO MOTOYOYOGI**
*55-6 Motoyoyogicho, Shibuya City, Tokyo 151-0062, Japan*

Funky store with a bunch of crazy looking plants. Right next to sinot so conveniently placed for the combo.
### Places

**21_21 Design**
*Japan, 〒107-0052 Tokyo, Minato City, Akasaka, 9 Chome−7−6 東京ミッドタウン ミッドタウン・ガーデン*

Contemporary Japanese museum featuring rotating exhibits. The one I went to was about the use raw materials in interior design. If you're a building enjoyer, the museum features a brutalist design language inside and outside. 

**Inokashira Park**
*1 Chome-18-31 Gotenyama, Musashino, Tokyo 180-0005, Japan*

My favorite park (and there are many in Tokyo!) A little way out of the city core, but a relaxing get-away from busy Tokyo. In Kichijoji, so if you're in the area, come here.
