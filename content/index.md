Welcome!

This is my digital garden of sorts on the Internet where I store notes and insights of  things that interests me.

I'm currently working at the intersection between artificial intelligence and distributed computing at Microsoft. How do we leverage the impact of artificial intelligence with the scale of distributed infrastructure to empower residents of the web?

On a broader level, I care deeply about leveraging technology to create spaces that empower people to grow. This space here is to me an opportunity to share and track my own growth in my creative endeavors. 

Here are some places you may want to visit:

- [My bookshelf](/content/books.md): books that currently being read, are read or are to read
- [The film room](/content/movies.md): movies that I've been meaning to watch
- [Somewhere!](content/travels.md): places that I've been to 
- [Ungatekeeping fashion](content/fashion.md): blurbs about anything related to fashion
